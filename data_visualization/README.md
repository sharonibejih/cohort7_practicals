# Industrial Strength Visualization libraries

__Data Visualization__ is a way of producing a pictoral representation of a dataset. It's an important approach to exploring the data features so as to gain meaningful insights surrounding the information visualized.

This practical focuses on real-world data story telling, using Python libraries like [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), as the visualization tools.


## To-Do:
With the knowledge gathered during the pratical session, expand more on your data analysis and visualization plots to gain insights on other fractions of the data you think we didn't explore.
Merge all findings (you're free to use/include what was done during the practical) to write a blog.

Your blog should include, but not be limited to the following details:
- Data Summary and its source
- Plots and short story accompanying each plot
- A well constructed conclusion.


### Submission
You'd be submitting a link to your blog post.
